            <h3>Boost – KTCC Mall</h3>
            <p>Part-time staff = Customer service, cashier, and drink preparation. <br> • I only worked for one day and didn’t show up the next hehe. It was my very first job in F&B after finishing SPM</p>

            <h3>NOSJA Studio – Jalan Anpas</h3>
            <p>•This is my second F&B job. I worked here for 2 months, often being the only staff, and sometimes my boss would leave me alone, making it feel like the shop was all mine. Working here was fun, but a bit scary since I sometimes got home at 1 a.m.</p>

            <h3>Gamelan Dancer</h3>
            <p>•I was a gamelan dancer from when I was 11 until 13. <br> I even performed for VIPs at various events. <br> It was sad that I couldn’t continue dancing as I got older because my dad didn’t allow it, but the experience is something I’ll never forget. <br>  The best part was the daily training, getting all dressed up and made up for performances,<br> and of course, earning some money and enjoying the food afterwards!</p>

            <p>•My internship was at the end of semester 4, and it was really great.<br> I gained a lot of experience, and internship here also made me enjoy library-related subjects more. <br>before this, I only liked record management subject but not for now. I hope I can continue in this field and get a good job in the future!</p>

            <p>•I played netball starting when I was 5, then stopped at 12 after representing my school.<br> I picked it up again at 15 for school competitions, then played again at 16–17,<br>  and finally stopped.I really enjoyed playing netball, but I always felt a bit insecure because some of my friends were better than me huhu.</p>

            <h3>Batik Cake and Cheesekut Seller at School</h3>
            <p>•My sister and I made batik cakes and cheesecakes, then sold them at school to my friends. It was fun to make, but not many people bought them,<br> and I eventually stopped because I was too lazy to keep making them</p>

            <h3>Dropship</h3>
            <p>•I did a cookie dropshipping business. <br>It was fun because  I got to sell cookies and also get some for free! <br>The only downside was I had to spend money to buy stock,<br> and I barely made any profit only about RM5 for me . But hey, I even got ‘Top Dropship’ because my cookies sold fast!</p>

            <p>•This was my first time hiking with friends. <br>I never went before because I was scared of getting lost or… <br>kidnapped by ‘bunian’ . Hiking was actually fun and felt healthy, though I had to wake up super early to catch the sunset!</p>

            <h3>Grab Student Driver</h3>
            <p>•I did Grab deliveries for UiTM Machang students. I started in semester 3, <br> in just one month, I earned almost RM1,000! After semesters 4 and 5, it slowed down because I was lazy, so I only did Grab whenever I felt like it.</p>
